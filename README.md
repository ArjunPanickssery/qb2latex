# qb2latex
Use an excel spreadsheet to write quiz bowl packets which can be easily converted into formatted LaTeX packets.

*Note that this application is somewhat experimental and can make formatting errors in some cases. Review the generated pdfs before use.*

## Instructions

Fill in the red-highlighted cells in the excel template. Filling in the tiebreaker content is optional.

Run the exceltolatex.exe file.

Alternatively, you can run the python file directly. Use your LaTeX distribution (e.g. MikTeX) to install `pdflatex`, and use pip to install `xlrd`.
